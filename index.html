      <p>My full name is Alexander Burrosquieta, but most people call me Alex for short but whichever is fine. I was born and raised in Austin, Texas and have been living here for practically my whole life up to this point. I like to think of myself as a creative person. I like to create an abundance of things and even better if its things that can help others. </p>

      <p>I would also describe myself as a homebody. Most often I work on personal hobbies such as photography or playing video games. But I find that I also enjoy myself in the outdoors alot.</p>
